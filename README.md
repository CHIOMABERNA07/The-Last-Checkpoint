Greetings Sir,

   My able tutor! I just wanted to take a moment to share how ready and excited I am to start this new step in my career path — Software Development. This Bootcamp has been a significant turning point for me. Even though everything moved at a fast pace (which, I guess, is why it’s called a Bootcamp), it gave me a strong foundation and opened my eyes to how much I truly enjoy solving problems through code.

  I’ll soon be moving on to study Law in school — something I’ve wanted to do for a while now.  At first, these two fields might seem unrelated, but I’ve realized that law and software development share a surprising amount in common — structure, logic, precision, and the need for creative problem-solving.
  My goal is to blend both worlds: Using my legal knowledge to understand systems, ethics, and digital rights, while applying my tech skills to create innovative and socially responsible digital solutions.
  
  Coming to GoMyCode, I didn't actually have any particular course in mind, all I knew was that I wanted to learn tech. I accepted the suggestion from the course advisor with the hope that I would learn more tech skills as time goes on. I'm art inclined so I guess from here I'll learn graphic design or any other related courses to add to my portfolio.

During my time in the Bootcamp, I was opportuned to learn: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. Version control (Git & GitHub) and lots more. At least, I'm way better than I was before coming here. I believe that anything is possible and achievable with consistency and positivity. 

Although we were rushed, that experience helped me learn how to think quickly, debug effectively, and push through challenges — all qualities I believe every real-world developer needs.

I don't plan on letting tech out of my hands and I'm not giving up. I'll keep on coding and building and gaining more knowledge through real-world and personal experiences. I plan to keep improving and deepening my understanding of software development, taking on small projects, and learning modern tools and frameworks to grow into a strong, well-rounded developer.

I want to make you and GoMyCode proud by representing both well wherever I go — through my dedication, integrity, and continuous learning.

As I prepare to balance school and development, I would really appreciate it if you could refer me to remote or flexible opportunities that I can handle as a student. It would mean a lot to have the chance to keep gaining hands-on experience while studying. I would also appreciate your continuous guidance even after my journey here at GoMyCode.

This Bootcamp wasn’t just a course — it was the beginning of a lifelong journey.
Thank you for your guidance, patience, and all the support.

Here’s to growth, consistency, and making an impact — one line of code at a time.

-Yours trulyy,
Chioma
